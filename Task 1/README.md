#Introduction
## Tools Selection !!
In the beginning, I spent sometime about searching for various tools that I may use in my project. 

### Deep Learning Framework
I started with finding a suitable deep learning framework for this project. Here I am listing all the options I considered.

* [**Tensorflow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [**Theono**](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
* [**Keras**](https://keras.io/)
* [**Caffe**](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
* [**Torch**](http://torch.ch/)
* [**Dl4j**](https://deeplearning4j.org/)

I had used Tensorflow earlier, so without much doubt, Tensorflow was my first choice. But to make things little easy, I chose to go with Keras(with Tensorflow backend). I found that it provides an easy implementation of deep neural nets. I installed Keras with Tensorflow as the backend, with GPU support.
